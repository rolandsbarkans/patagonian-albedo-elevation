## 🏔️ Surface Reflectivity vs. Elevation Change in the Southern Patagonian Icefield

This project investigates how glacier surface reflectivity (albedo) relates to elevation changes across the Southern Patagonian Icefield between 2000 and 2015. The analysis uses Bayesian linear modeling to quantify how variations in albedo correspond to long-term elevation loss, leveraging geospatial raster data and probabilistic modeling in Python. All data processing, visualization, and model comparison steps are documented in the main notebook.
